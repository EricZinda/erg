# English Resource Grammar

The English Resource Grammar is a broad-coverage HPSG grammar of English.

This project is currently only for [issue-tracking](https://github.com/delph-in/erg/issues).

Please see the [ERG website](http://www.delph-in.net/erg/)
or [wiki](http://moin.delph-in.net/ErgTop) for more information.

## Getting the grammar

The ERG grammar files can be obtained via SVN:

```bash
$ svn checkout http://svn.delph-in.net/erg/trunk
```

It is also available as part of the [LOGON distribution](http://moin.delph-in.net/LogonTop).

The quickest way to get started using the ERG is with the
pre-compiled binary available with the
[ACE](http://sweaglesw.org/linguistics/ace/) processor.
